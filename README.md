Lab Report: First Come First Serve (FCFS) Algorithm

Objective:
The objective of this lab report is to understand and analyze the FCFS scheduling algorithm, which executes processes based on their arrival order.

Algorithm Overview:
FCFS is the simplest scheduling algorithm.
Processes are executed in the order they arrive (FIFO).

Characteristics:
Supports both preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling.
Managed with a FIFO queue.
Easy to implement.

Conclusion:
FCFS executes processes in the order they arrive, making it straightforward but not always efficient.
